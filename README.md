# scribble
CNN that recognizes scribbles using google's Quick, Draw! Data set


Intoduction
===
The following project is my attempt of getting a better understanding of Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and Image Processing. I have implemented a basic generic convolutional neural network (CNN) model and trained it on thousands of images.
The model can detect the object that is drawn on a image from Google's Quick, Draw! database.


Google's Quick, Draw!
===
[Google Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) is a site that shows the power of machine learning in image recognition.
The site saves all the data.
